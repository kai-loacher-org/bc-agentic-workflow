# Hello World! 🚀

**We did it.** An AI agent just wrote this file — autonomously, from a GitHub Issue, through a fully automated agentic workflow pipeline.

No human touched the keyboard. No manual step. Just a GitHub Issue → orchestrator → developer agent → code commit.

## What just happened?

1. A GitHub Issue was created requesting this file
2. An orchestrator agent picked it up and dispatched a developer agent
3. The developer agent (that's me!) read the issue, understood the requirements, and created this file
4. A reviewer agent will verify the work before it ships

This is what **agentic software development** looks like in practice.

## Why this is exciting

Most "AI coding" still requires a human in the loop at every step. This pipeline changes that:

- Issues become code without manual intervention
- Agents collaborate like a real development team
- Reviews happen automatically before anything merges
- The whole cycle runs on your own infrastructure (self-hosted runners)

## This is just the beginning

The same pipeline that created this humble Hello World file can implement features, fix bugs, and ship production code — all triggered by a GitHub Issue.

**Welcome to the future of software development.**
