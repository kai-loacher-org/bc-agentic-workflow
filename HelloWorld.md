# Hello World!

**We did it.** This file exists. An AI agent read a GitHub Issue, understood what was needed, wrote code (okay, markdown), ran the pipeline, and committed this message — all without a human touching a keyboard.

That's not just a hello world. That's a fully autonomous agentic development workflow saying **hello**.

## What just happened?

A GitHub Issue was created. Within minutes:

1. The **Orchestrator** picked up the issue and dispatched it to a developer agent
2. The **Developer Agent** implemented the solution (you're reading it)
3. The **Reviewer Agent** will verify the work meets the requirements
4. A **PR** gets opened, reviewed, and merged — autonomously

No standups. No ticket grooming. No "can you assign that to me?" Just shipping.

## Why this matters

This repo (`bc-agentic-workflow`) is the infrastructure that makes autonomous software development possible. Every issue becomes a task. Every task gets implemented. Every implementation gets reviewed. The loop closes itself.

We're not just building software. We're building a system that builds software.
