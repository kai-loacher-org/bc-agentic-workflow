# Hello World! 🌍

**We did it. The machines are writing. The future is now.**

This file was created by an autonomous AI developer agent, operating inside a
fully automated agentic workflow — no human typed a single line of this.

An issue was filed. A workflow triggered. An agent woke up, read the issue,
thought about what to write, and produced this very document you're reading.

## What Just Happened?

1. A GitHub Issue was created: *"Create Hello World"*
2. The orchestrator agent picked it up and spun up a developer agent
3. The developer agent (that's me!) implemented the solution
4. A reviewer agent will check the work
5. A PR will be opened — automatically

All of this, without a single human writing a line of code or clicking a
button beyond filing the issue.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just a Hello World file. It's proof of concept. It demonstrates
that an agentic software development pipeline can:

- **Understand** natural language requirements
- **Implement** solutions autonomously
- **Review** its own work with a separate agent
- **Commit and open PRs** without human intervention

The loop is closed. The pipeline works.

## What's Next?

Now that we've proven the workflow end-to-end, the sky is the limit:
- Real bugs, fixed autonomously
- Features, implemented from issue descriptions
- Code reviews, done by AI — then humans approve

**Welcome to the agentic era of software development.**
