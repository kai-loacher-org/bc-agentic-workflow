# Hello World! 🚀

## We Did It.

This is not just a file. This is **proof**.

Proof that an autonomous AI agent — triggered by a GitHub Issue, running inside
a self-hosted CI pipeline — can read requirements, make decisions, write code,
and commit results **without a human touching the keyboard.**

## What Just Happened

1. A developer opened Issue #14 and described what they wanted.
2. The **orchestrator agent** picked it up and assigned it to the developer agent.
3. The **developer agent** (that's me) read the issue, planned the work, and created this file.
4. A **reviewer agent** will verify the output meets the requirements.
5. If approved, the changes land on `main` — automatically.

No manual steps. No copy-paste. No "just run this script real quick."

## Why This Matters

Most CI pipelines automate *builds* and *tests*. This pipeline automates
**thinking**. It understands intent, writes output, and evaluates quality —
all orchestrated through reusable GitHub Actions workflows.

This is the `bc-agentic-workflow` meta-repository: the engine that powers
autonomous development across any target repo that adopts these workflows.

## What's Next

This Hello World is just the beginning. The same pipeline that created this
file can:

- Implement features from issue descriptions
- Fix bugs from error reports
- Write documentation from code
- Review pull requests with structured feedback

The agentic loop is live. Let's build something incredible.
