# Hello World! 🌍

**We did it.** A fully autonomous AI agent just created this file — on its own, from a GitHub Issue, with zero human intervention in the implementation step.

## What Just Happened?

An orchestrator read Issue #10, spun up a developer agent, and that agent:

1. Understood the requirements
2. Wrote this file
3. Committed it to the repository
4. Handed it off for code review

All without a human writing a single line.

## Why This Is Exciting

This repository is the foundation of an **agentic development workflow** — where GitHub Issues become code, and code becomes pull requests, through a fully automated pipeline powered by Claude.

We're not just automating tasks. We're building a system that **thinks, plans, and ships**.

## The Stack

- **GitHub Actions** — orchestrates the workflow
- **Claude (Anthropic)** — the brain behind the developer and reviewer agents
- **GitHub Issues & Projects** — the communication layer between humans and agents

## What's Next?

The pipeline is live. The agents are running. The only limit now is the imagination of the people writing the issues.

Welcome to the future of software development. 🚀
