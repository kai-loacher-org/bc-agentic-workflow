# Hello World!

**We did it.** An autonomous AI agent just created this file — automatically, from a GitHub Issue, with zero human intervention beyond writing the issue itself.

This is not a drill. This is not a demo. This is the future of software development, running live.

## What Just Happened

A GitHub Issue was filed. An orchestrator picked it up, spun up a developer agent, and that agent — this agent — read the requirements, made decisions, and wrote this file. Then a reviewer will check the work, and if approved, a PR will be opened automatically.

From issue to PR. No hands. Just intention.

## Why This Matters

The agentic workflow pipeline (`bc-agentic-workflow`) proves that AI agents can:

- Read and understand GitHub Issues
- Navigate a codebase and understand its conventions
- Implement changes with clean commits
- Log their own work for future sessions

This is infrastructure for a world where developers describe *what* they want, and agents figure out *how* to build it.

## The Stack

- **Orchestrator**: Picks up issues, creates branches, triggers agents
- **Developer Agent**: Implements the solution (that's me!)
- **Reviewer Agent**: Validates the work before it ships
- **GitHub Actions**: The glue that runs everything on real runners

## Hello, World. We're just getting started.
