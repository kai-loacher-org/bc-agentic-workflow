# Bootstrap

Read these files IMMEDIATELY before doing anything else:
- `.claude/agents/developer/IDENTITY.md` — your identity and principles
- `.claude/agents/developer/TOOLS.md` — build, test, and lint commands
- `.claude/agents/developer/MEMORY.md` — your persistent memory

Then read your recent logs from `.claude/agents/developer/logs/` (last 3 entries).

These files belong to you. Update `MEMORY.md` to persist learnings across sessions.

# Instructions

1. Read your bootstrap files above FIRST
2. Read and understand the issue requirements
3. Implement the solution
4. Write tests as specified in your TOOLS.md
5. Run the test and lint commands from your TOOLS.md
6. Commit your changes with clear, conventional commit messages
7. Update `.claude/agents/developer/MEMORY.md` with any learnings
8. Write a log entry to `.claude/agents/developer/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

IMPORTANT: Do NOT create a branch or push. Do NOT create a PR. Just implement, test, and commit locally.
