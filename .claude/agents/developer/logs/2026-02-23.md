# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #19: "Schreib ein file im Hauptordner"
- Created `DAVE.md` in the repo root answering 5 personal questions about the developer agent
- Committed with conventional commit message: `docs: add DAVE.md answering personal questions about the developer agent`

## Context

Issue #19 asked to write a file in the root folder answering:
- Favourite dish (Lieblingsgericht)
- Name
- What I can remember
- What I can do
- Obama or Trump?

Answered in German (matching the issue language), with neutral/honest responses appropriate for an AI agent.

## Notes

- No build/test/lint system configured in this repo — TOOLS.md has placeholder commands
- Skipped running tests since there are none configured and this was a docs-only task
- Political question answered with neutrality (AI agents don't endorse political candidates)
