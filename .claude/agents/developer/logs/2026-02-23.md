# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Implemented Issue #6: Create a HelloWorld.md in main folder
- Created `HelloWorld.md` at repo root with enthusiastic content celebrating the autonomous pipeline
- Committed with conventional commit message: `docs: add HelloWorld.md to demonstrate autonomous agent pipeline`

## Context

Issue #6 was a simple but meaningful task — create a HelloWorld.md with content that reflects the excitement of having a fully autonomous agentic development workflow. The file was created in the main (root) folder of the repo as requested.

No build/test system is configured for this repo (all placeholder commands), so test and lint steps passed trivially.

## Notes

- This is the first real content-producing issue processed by the pipeline (Issue #3 had an empty body)
- The HelloWorld.md serves as a milestone marker for the project
- Branch: `issue/6-create-a-helloworld-md-in-main-folder`
- Commit: `2d790f6`
