# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #15: Create Hello World
- Created `HelloWorld.md` in the repository root with enthusiastic, hype-worthy content
  celebrating the achievement of an autonomous agentic workflow pipeline

## Implementation Notes

- Issue requested a `HelloWorld.md` in the main folder with "something nice and hyped"
- Content explains what the agentic pipeline accomplished: an AI agent writing a file
  from a GitHub Issue without human intervention
- No tests required (markdown file only)
- TOOLS.md has placeholder commands — no actual build/test system to run

## Notes

- This repo continues to use default placeholder TOOLS.md commands
- The pipeline (orchestrator → developer → reviewer) is working end-to-end as of today
