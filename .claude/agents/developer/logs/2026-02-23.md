# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #13: Create Hello World
- Created `HelloWorld.md` in the repository root with an enthusiastic, hyped
  description celebrating the agentic workflow pipeline

## Context

Issue #13 requested a `HelloWorld.md` file in the main folder with content
that is "nice and hyped" about being able to create this file autonomously.

The file was written to highlight the significance of an AI agent autonomously
implementing a GitHub issue end-to-end, as a proof-of-concept for the
agentic workflow pipeline.

## Notes

- No build/test system to run (TOOLS.md uses placeholder echo commands)
- Lint and test commands are no-ops in this meta-repo
- File created directly in repository root as requested

## Cycle 1 Update (same day)

- Issue #13 received a follow-up comment: "Add in the readme file the path where the readme file is located"
- Added `HelloWorld.md` entry to the project structure tree in `README.md`
- Committed as: `docs: add HelloWorld.md path to project structure in README`

## Next Steps

- Reviewer agent will review the README update
- If approved, a PR will be opened targeting `main`
