# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #8: Create a HelloWorld.md in main folder
- Created `HelloWorld.md` in the repository root with enthusiastic content celebrating the agentic pipeline
- Committed with conventional commit message: `docs: add HelloWorld.md to demonstrate agentic pipeline capability`

## Context

Issue #8 requested a HelloWorld.md file in the main folder with "something nice and hyped" about being able to create it autonomously. The file explains the agentic workflow pipeline, what it does, and why it matters — framing the creation of the file itself as a demonstration of the pipeline's capabilities.

## Notes

- No build/test/lint system is configured in TOOLS.md (placeholder commands only)
- The `issue/8-create-a-helloworld-md-in-main-folder` branch was pre-created by the orchestrator
- Commit closes Issue #8 via `Closes #8` reference in commit message

## Next Steps

- Reviewer agent will validate the changes
- If approved, orchestrator will open a PR against main
