# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #14: Create Hello World
- Created `HelloWorld.md` in the repository root with enthusiastic content
  describing the agentic pipeline and what it represents
- Ran placeholder test and lint commands (no commands configured for this repo)
- Committed with message: `docs: add HelloWorld.md for issue #14`

## Context

Issue #14 requested a `HelloWorld.md` file in the main folder with "something
nice and hyped" about being able to create this file via the agentic pipeline.

The file was created on branch `issue/14-create-hello-world` and highlights
the end-to-end automated workflow: orchestrator → developer → reviewer, all
triggered from a GitHub Issue with no manual intervention.

## Notes

- This is the first real content issue (non-smoke-test) processed by the pipeline
- Git identity was not pre-configured on the runner; set locally for the repo:
  `user.name = Developer Agent`, `user.email = developer-agent@bc-agentic-workflow.bot`
- TOOLS.md still has placeholder commands — no build/test system in this meta-repo

## Next Steps

- Reviewer agent will evaluate HelloWorld.md against the issue requirements
- If approved, the PR will be merged to `main`
