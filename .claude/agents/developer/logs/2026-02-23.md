# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Implemented Issue #10: Create a HelloWorld.md in main folder
- Created `HelloWorld.md` in the repository root with enthusiastic content celebrating the agentic pipeline milestone

## Context

This was the first issue with a real, concrete implementation requirement. The file serves as a celebration of the autonomous workflow — an agent writing a file purely from a GitHub Issue description.

Content highlights:
- Explains what the agentic workflow does
- Celebrates the milestone of autonomous code generation
- Describes the tech stack (GitHub Actions + Claude + GitHub Issues/Projects)

## Notes

- No build/test/lint system configured in this repo (placeholder TOOLS.md)
- Branch: `issue/10-create-a-helloworld-md-in-main-folder`
- No PR created per agent instructions (reviewer agent handles that step)

## Next Steps

- Reviewer agent will assess the implementation and create a PR if approved
