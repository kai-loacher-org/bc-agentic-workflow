# Developer Log — 2026-02-23

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #13: Create Hello World
- Created `HelloWorld.md` in the repository root with an enthusiastic, hyped
  description celebrating the agentic workflow pipeline

## Context

Issue #13 requested a `HelloWorld.md` file in the main folder with content
that is "nice and hyped" about being able to create this file autonomously.

The file was written to highlight the significance of an AI agent autonomously
implementing a GitHub issue end-to-end, as a proof-of-concept for the
agentic workflow pipeline.

## Notes

- No build/test system to run (TOOLS.md uses placeholder echo commands)
- Lint and test commands are no-ops in this meta-repo
- File created directly in repository root as requested

## Next Steps

- Reviewer agent will review the `HelloWorld.md` content and commit quality
- If approved, a PR will be opened targeting `main`
