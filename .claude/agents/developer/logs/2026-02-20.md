## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #3: Test123 (empty test issue to verify the developer agent pipeline)
- No code changes required — issue had no description or requirements
- Previous cycle 0 failed; this run (cycle 1) verifies the agent can handle empty/test issues gracefully

## Project Notes

- This is the `bc-agentic-workflow` repo itself — the developer agent runs on the same repo it manages
- TOOLS.md has no commands configured (placeholder defaults), so test/lint/build steps are no-ops
- The agent pipeline is functional: checkout → fetch issue → assemble prompt → run Claude → commit → push → PR

## Next Steps

- No follow-up needed for this test issue
- When real feature issues arrive, update TOOLS.md with actual build/test/lint commands
