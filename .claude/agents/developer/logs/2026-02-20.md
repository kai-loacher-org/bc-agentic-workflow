# Developer Log — 2026-02-20

## Tasks Completed

- Processed Issue #3: Test123 (empty description — smoke test of the pipeline)
- No code implementation required (issue had no description or requirements)
- Created this log entry to verify the pipeline end-to-end flow works

## Context

Issue #3 was a test issue with an empty body. The previous cycle 0 run failed.
This cycle successfully ran the developer agent workflow on runner-developer-2.

The pipeline itself (orchestrator → developer → reviewer) is fully implemented
based on the design in `docs/plans/2026-02-20-agentic-workflow-design.md`.

## Notes

- Default TOOLS.md has placeholder commands (no actual build/test system configured)
- This repo (`bc-agentic-workflow`) is the meta-repo holding the reusable workflows
- Target repos must configure their own `.claude/agents/developer/TOOLS.md`
- Log files are per-repo and track agent activity over time

## Next Steps

- Test issues should have at least a minimal description to give the agent something to implement
- Once the pipeline is verified end-to-end, real issues can be processed
